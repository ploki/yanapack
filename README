Yanapack: Yet Another Nodal Analysis PACKage

This nodal analysis software is dedicated to electro-mechanical-acoustical equivalent circuit simulation (from a lumped element model).

Elements simulated

Resistors
Capacitors
Indoctors
Transformer
Gyrator
current sources
tension sources
pistonic radiator   (complex impedance built with Bessel functions)
port impedance      (port found in vented enclosures)
box impedance 
free air impedance  (from the source to the listener)

At this time, only linear analysis in the frequency domain is supported. A simple Gauss-Jordan algorithm is used and no special attention is taken on conditioning the system of equations.

It is work in progress.

This library will be used in a improved version of the loudspeaker graphing calculator ( https://github.com/ploki/Loudspeaker/ )
