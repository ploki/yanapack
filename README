Yanapack: Yet Another Nodal Analyser PACKage

This nodal analyser is dedicated to electro-mechanico-acoustical equivalent circuit simulation.

At this time, new netlist is provided to simulation core using your {vim,emacs} and gcc.

Heavy work in progress.

Elements simulated

Resistors
Capacitors
Indoctors
Transformer
Gyrator
current sources
tension sources
pistonic radiator   (complex impedance built with Bessel functions)
port impedance      (port found in vented enclosures)
box impedance 
free air impedance  (from the source to the listener)

It is work in progress.

This library will be used in a improved version of the loudspeaker graphing calculator ( https://github.com/ploki/Loudspeaker/ )
